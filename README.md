# Overview

Just trying to learn the Rust language, I heard its a popular language, so I wanted a little spin at it.

Basically the project just reads all the lines from one text file and writes it on the second text file.

Like I said above, I just wanted to see how I like the Rust language

# Development Environment

Visual Studio code, and had to install rust onto the computer.

Rust Language
I belive these are the libraries use 
std::fs::File;
use std::io::{self, BufRead, BufReader, Write};
I guess I still don't full understand what libraries really are

# Future Work

{Make a list of things that you need to fix, improve, and add in the future.}

- In the future I just want to learn more about rust. For this project I just did something small because of different assignments and finals were due.
- Like I said above my main focus in improving this or what I want to do in the future is just to learn more about the language.
